## 🦯 Project Goals

The purpose of **b-port** is to:

* Present my best front-end projects and experiments (React, TypeScript, Next.js).
* Serve as a living CV and design showcase for potential employers.
* Reflect my commitment to **clean, maintainable, and scalable code**.

## 🧮 Developer Notes

* All components follow modular folder structure for reusability.
* Fonts are automatically optimized with [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts).
* Designed with **performance**, **accessibility**, and **responsive UI** in mind.
* Ideal for showcasing front-end architecture and animations in production-level quality.
