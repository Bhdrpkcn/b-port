The UI, designed with Tailwind CSS, includes dynamic animations such as a mouse-following background effect on desktop and a subtle pulse on mobile. It uses Zustand/Redux for state management, Cloudinary for media storage, and MongoDB with Mongoose for backend data handling. Optimized with SSR, lazy loading, and API caching, the app is fully responsive. Hosted on Vercel with GitHub CI/CD, it demonstrates expertise in modern UI/UX and full-stack development.",

At this stage, I was still solidifying my understanding of React components, state management, and UI logic. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Git and GitHub Pages for deployment, teaching me the fundamentals of version control, committing, and pushing changes efficiently. Styling was done entirely with CSS, where I built a structured design system, focusing on component reusability, especially with the card component. It also introduced me to API calls (my very first!), URL parameters for response filtering, and implementing a structured filtering logic, enhancing my ability to work with dynamic data.",
